## Feature Representation

The Feature representation is created by the pre-trained model

Word2Vec has the following properties:
1. **Limited Dimensions** - Every word can be represented by a vector within a limited dimension
2. **Sparsity is reduced**
3. **Semantic meaning is captured** - Word vectors capture the semantic meaning between them
